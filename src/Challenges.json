The Elves have even given you a map; on it, they've used stars to mark the top fifty locations that are likely to be having problems.\r\n\r\nYou've been doing this long enough to know that to restore snow operations, you need to check all fifty stars by December 25th.\r\n\r\nCollect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!\r\n\r\nYou try to ask why they can't just use a weather machine (\"not powerful enough\") and where they're even sending you (\"the sky\") and why your map looks mostly blank (\"you sure ask a lot of questions\") and hang on did you just say the sky (\"of course, where do you think snow comes from\") when you realize that the Elves are already loading you into a trebuchet (\"please hold still, we need to strap you in\").\r\n\r\nAs they're making the final adjustments, they discover that their calibration document (your puzzle input) has been amended by a very young Elf who was apparently just excited to show off her art skills. Consequently, the Elves are having trouble reading the values on the document.\r\n\r\nThe newly-improved calibration document consists of lines of text; each line originally contained a specific calibration value that the Elves now need to recover. On each line, the calibration value can be found by combining the first digit and the last digit (in that order) to form a single two-digit number.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n1abc2\r\npqr3stu8vwx\r\na1b2c3d4e5f\r\ntreb7uchet\r\n\r\nIn this example, the calibration values of these four lines are 12, 38, 15, and 77.

You gently land in a fluffy pile of leaves. It's quite cold, but you don't see much snow. An Elf runs over to greet you.\r\n\r\nThe Elf explains that you've arrived at Snow Island and apologizes for the lack of snow. He'll be happy to explain the situation, but it's a bit of a walk, so you have some time. They don't get many visitors up here; would you like to play a game in the meantime?\r\n\r\nAs you walk, the Elf shows you a small bag and some cubes which are either red, green, or blue. Each time you play this game, he will hide a secret number of cubes of each color in the bag, and your goal is to figure out information about the number of cubes.\r\n\r\nTo get information, once a bag has been loaded with cubes, the Elf will reach into the bag, grab a handful of random cubes, show them to you, and then put them back in the bag. He'll do this a few times per game.\r\n\r\nYou play several games and record the information from each game (your puzzle input). Each game is listed with its ID number (like the 11 in Game 11: ...) followed by a semicolon-separated list of subsets of cubes that were revealed from the bag (like 3 red, 5 green, 4 blue).\r\n\r\nFor example, the record of a few games might look like this:\r\n\r\nGame 1: 3 blue, 4 red; 1 red, 2 green, 6 blue; 2 green\r\nGame 2: 1 blue, 2 green; 3 green, 4 blue, 1 red; 1 green, 1 blue\r\nGame 3: 8 green, 6 blue, 20 red; 5 blue, 4 red, 13 green; 5 green, 1 red\r\nGame 4: 1 green, 3 red, 6 blue; 3 green, 6 red; 3 green, 15 blue, 14 red\r\nGame 5: 6 red, 1 blue, 3 green; 2 blue, 1 red, 2 green\r\n\r\nIn game 1, three sets of cubes are revealed from the bag (and then put back again). The first set is 3 blue cubes and 4 red cubes; the second set is 1 red cube, 2 green cubes, and 6 blue cubes; the third set is only 2 green cubes.\r\n\r\nThe Elf would first like to know which games would have been possible if the bag contained only 12 red cubes, 13 green cubes, and 14 blue cubes?\r\n\r\nIn the example above, games 1, 2, and 5 would have been possible if the bag had been loaded with that configuration. However, game 3 would have been impossible because at one point the Elf showed you 20 red cubes at once; similarly, game 4 would also have been impossible because the Elf showed you 15 blue cubes at once. If you add up the IDs of the games that would have been possible, you get 8.\r\n\r\nDetermine which games would have been possible if the bag had been loaded with only 12 red cubes, 13 green cubes, and 14 blue cubes. What is the sum of the IDs of those games?",

He isn't sure why the water stopped; however, he can show you how to get to the water source to check it out for yourself. It's just up ahead!\r\n\r\nAs you continue your walk, the Elf poses a second question: in each game you played, what is the fewest number of cubes of each color that could have been in the bag to make the game possible?\r\n\r\nAgain consider the example games from earlier:\r\n\r\nGame 1: 3 blue, 4 red; 1 red, 2 green, 6 blue; 2 green\r\nGame 2: 1 blue, 2 green; 3 green, 4 blue, 1 red; 1 green, 1 blue\r\nGame 3: 8 green, 6 blue, 20 red; 5 blue, 4 red, 13 green; 5 green, 1 red\r\nGame 4: 1 green, 3 red, 6 blue; 3 green, 6 red; 3 green, 15 blue, 14 red\r\nGame 5: 6 red, 1 blue, 3 green; 2 blue, 1 red, 2 green\r\n\r\n    In game 1, the game could have been played with as few as 4 red, 2 green, and 6 blue cubes. If any color had even one fewer cube, the game would have been impossible.\r\n    Game 2 could have been played with a minimum of 1 red, 3 green, and 4 blue cubes.\r\n    Game 3 must have been played with at least 20 red, 13 green, and 6 blue cubes.\r\n    Game 4 required at least 14 red, 3 green, and 15 blue cubes.\r\n    Game 5 needed no fewer than 6 red, 3 green, and 2 blue cubes in the bag.\r\n\r\nThe power of a set of cubes is equal to the numbers of red, green, and blue cubes multiplied together. The power of the minimum set of cubes in game 1 is 48. In games 2-5 it was 12, 1560, 630, and 36, respectively. Adding up these five powers produces the sum 2286.\r\n\r\nFor each game, find the minimum set of cubes that must have been present. What is the sum of the power of these sets?",

You go inside.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't take long to find the gondolas, but there seems to be a problem: they're not moving.\r\n\r\n\"Aaah!\"\r\n\r\nYou turn around to see a slightly-greasy Elf with a wrench and a look of surprise. \"Sorry, I wasn't expecting anyone! The gondola lift isn't working right now; it'll still be a while before I can fix it.\" You offer to help.\r\n\r\nThe engineer explains that an engine part seems to be missing from the engine, but nobody can figure out which one. If you can add up all the part numbers in the engine schematic, it should be easy to work out which part is missing.\r\n\r\nThe engine schematic (your puzzle input) consists of a visual representation of the engine. There are lots of numbers and symbols you don't really understand, but apparently any number adjacent to a symbol, even diagonally, is a \"part number\" and should be included in your sum. (Periods (.) do not count as a symbol.)\r\n\r\nHere is an example engine schematic:\r\n\r\n467..114..\r\n...*......\r\n..35..633.\r\n......#...\r\n617*......\r\n.....+.58.\r\n..592.....\r\n......755.\r\n...$.*....\r\n.664.598..\r\n\r\nIn this schematic, two numbers are not part numbers because they are not adjacent to a symbol: 114 (top right) and 58 (middle right).

As the circle of Snow Island recedes below you, an entire new landmass suddenly appears above you! The gondola carries you to the surface of the new island and lurches into the station.\r\n\r\nAs you exit the gondola, the first thing you notice is that the air here is much warmer than it was on Snow Island. It's also quite humid. Is this where the water source is?\r\n\r\nThe next thing you notice is an Elf sitting on the floor across the station in what seems to be a pile of colorful square cards.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! Hello!\" The Elf excitedly runs over to you. \"How may I be of service?\" You ask about water sources.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not sure; I just operate the gondola lift. That does sound like something we'd have, though - this is Island Island, after all! I bet the gardener would know. He's on a different island, though - er, the small kind surrounded by water, not the floating kind. We really need to come up with a better naming scheme. Tell you what: if you can help me with something quick, I'll let you borrow my boat and you can go visit the gardener. I got all these scratchcards as a gift, but I can't figure out what I've won.\"\r\n\r\nThe Elf leads you over to the pile of colorful cards. There, you discover dozens of scratchcards, all with their opaque covering already scratched off. Picking one up, it looks like each card has two lists of numbers separated by a vertical bar (|): a list of winning numbers and then a list of numbers you have. You organize the information into a table (your puzzle input).\r\n\r\nAs far as the Elf has been able to figure out, you have to figure out which of the numbers you have appear in the list of winning numbers. The first match makes the card worth one point and each match after the first doubles the point value of that card.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\nCard 1: 41 48 83 86 17 | 83 86  6 31 17  9 48 53\r\nCard 2: 13 32 20 16 61 | 61 30 68 82 17 32 24 19\r\nCard 3:  1 21 53 59 44 | 69 82 63 72 16 21 14  1\r\nCard 4: 41 92 73 84 69 | 59 84 76 51 58  5 54 83\r\nCard 5: 87 83 26 28 32 | 88 30 70 12 93 22 82 36\r\nCard 6: 31 18 13 56 72 | 74 77 10 23 35 67 36 11\r\n\r\nIn the above example, card 1 has five winning numbers (41, 48, 83, 86, and 17) and eight numbers you have (83, 86, 6, 31, 17, 9, 48, and 53). Of the numbers you have, four of them (48, 83, 17, and 86) are winning numbers! That means card 1 is worth 8 points (1 for the first match, then doubled three times for each of the three matches after the first).\r\n\r\n    Card 2 has two winning numbers (32 and 61), so it is worth 2 points.\r\n    Card 3 has two winning numbers (1 and 21), so it is worth 2 points.\r\n    Card 4 has one winning number (84), so it is worth 1 point.\r\n    Card 5 has no winning numbers, so it is worth no points.\r\n    Card 6 has no winning numbers, so it is worth no points.\r\n\r\nSo, in this example, the Elf's pile of scratchcards is worth 13 points.\r\n\r\nTake a seat in the large pile of colorful cards.

Instead, scratchcards only cause you to win more scratchcards equal to the number of winning numbers you have.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, you win copies of the scratchcards below the winning card equal to the number of matches. So, if card 10 were to have 5 matching numbers, you would win one copy each of cards 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15.\r\n\r\nCopies of scratchcards are scored like normal scratchcards and have the same card number as the card they copied. So, if you win a copy of card 10 and it has 5 matching numbers, it would then win a copy of the same cards that the original card 10 won: cards 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15. This process repeats until none of the copies cause you to win any more cards.

Can't make snow with dirty water. Don't worry, I'm sure we'll get more sand soon; we only turned off the water a few days... weeks... oh no.\" His face sinks into a look of horrified realization.\r\n\r\n\"I've been so busy making sure everyone here has food that I completely forgot to check why we stopped getting more sand! There's a ferry leaving soon that is headed over in that direction - it's much faster than your boat. Could you please go check it out?\"\r\n\r\nYou barely have time to agree to this request when he brings up another. \"While you wait for the ferry, maybe you can help us with our food production problem. The latest Island Island Almanac just arrived and we're having trouble making sense of it.\"\r\n\r\nThe almanac (your puzzle input) lists all of the seeds that need to be planted. It also lists what type of soil to use with each kind of seed, what type of fertilizer to use with each kind of soil, what type of water to use with each kind of fertilizer, and so on. Every type of seed, soil, fertilizer and so on is identified with a number, but numbers are reused by each category - that is, soil 123 and fertilizer 123 aren't necessarily related to each other.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\nseeds: 79 14 55 13\r\n\r\nseed-to-soil map:\r\n50 98 2\r\n52 50 48\r\n\r\nsoil-to-fertilizer map:\r\n0 15 37\r\n37 52 2\r\n39 0 15\r\n\r\nfertilizer-to-water map:\r\n49 53 8\r\n0 11 42\r\n42 0 7\r\n57 7 4\r\n\r\nwater-to-light map:\r\n88 18 7\r\n18 25 70\r\n\r\nlight-to-temperature map:\r\n45 77 23\r\n81 45 19\r\n68 64 13\r\n\r\ntemperature-to-humidity map:\r\n0 69 1\r\n1 0 69\r\n\r\nhumidity-to-location map:\r\n60 56 37\r\n56 93 4\r\n\r\nThe almanac starts by listing which seeds need to be planted: seeds 79, 14, 55, and 13.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the almanac contains a list of maps which describe how to convert numbers from a source category into numbers in a destination category. That is, the section that starts with seed-to-soil map: describes how to convert a seed number (the source) to a soil number (the destination). This lets the gardener and his team know which soil to use with which seeds, which water to use with which fertilizer, and so on.\r\n\r\nRather than list every source number and its corresponding destination number one by one, the maps describe entire ranges of numbers that can be converted. Each line within a map contains three numbers: the destination range start, the source range start, and the range length.\r\n\r\nConsider again the example seed-to-soil map:\r\n\r\n50 98 2\r\n52 50 48\r\n\r\nThe first line has a destination range start of 50, a source range start of 98, and a range length of 2. This line means that the source range starts at 98 and contains two values: 98 and 99. The destination range is the same length, but it starts at 50, so its two values are 50 and 51. With this information, you know that seed number 98 corresponds to soil number 50 and that seed number 99 corresponds to soil number 51.\r\n\r\nThe second line means that the source range starts at 50 and contains 48 values: 50, 51, ..., 96, 97. This corresponds to a destination range starting at 52 and also containing 48 values: 52, 53, ..., 98, 99. So, seed number 53 corresponds to soil number 55.\r\n\r\nAny source numbers that aren't mapped correspond to the same destination number. So, seed number 10 corresponds to soil number 10.\r\n\r\nSo, the entire list of seed numbers and their corresponding soil numbers looks like this:\r\n\r\nseed  soil\r\n0     0\r\n1     1\r\n...   ...\r\n48    48\r\n49    49\r\n50    52\r\n51    53\r\n...   ...\r\n96    98\r\n97    99\r\n98    50\r\n99    51\r\n\r\nWith this map, you can look up the soil number required for each initial seed number:\r\n\r\n    Seed number 79 corresponds to soil number 81.\r\n    Seed number 14 corresponds to soil number 14.\r\n    Seed number 55 corresponds to soil number 57.\r\n    Seed number 13 corresponds to soil number 13.\r\n\r\nThe gardener and his team want to get started as soon as possible, so they'd like to know the closest location that needs a seed. Using these maps, find the lowest location number that corresponds to any of the initial seeds. To do this, you'll need to convert each seed number through other categories until you can find its corresponding location number. In this example, the corresponding types are:\r\n\r\n    Seed 79, soil 81, fertilizer 81, water 81, light 74, temperature 78, humidity 78, location 82.\r\n    Seed 14, soil 14, fertilizer 53, water 49, light 42, temperature 42, humidity 43, location 43.\r\n    Seed 55, soil 57, fertilizer 57, water 53, light 46, temperature 82, humidity 82, location 86.\r\n    Seed 13, soil 13, fertilizer 52, water 41, light 34, temperature 34, humidity 35, location 35.\r\n\r\nSo, the lowest location number in this example is 35.\r\n\r\nWhat is the lowest location number that corresponds to any of the initial seed numbers?",

Best of all, the boat races are starting in just a few minutes.\r\n\r\nYou manage to sign up as a competitor in the boat races just in time. The organizer explains that it's not really a traditional race - instead, you will get a fixed amount of time during which your boat has to travel as far as it can, and you win if your boat goes the farthest.\r\n\r\nAs part of signing up, you get a sheet of paper (your puzzle input) that lists the time allowed for each race and also the best distance ever recorded in that race. To guarantee you win the grand prize, you need to make sure you go farther in each race than the current record holder.\r\n\r\nThe organizer brings you over to the area where the boat races are held. The boats are much smaller than you expected - they're actually toy boats, each with a big button on top. Holding down the button charges the boat, and releasing the button allows the boat to move. Boats move faster if their button was held longer, but time spent holding the button counts against the total race time. You can only hold the button at the start of the race, and boats don't move until the button is released.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\nTime:      7  15   30\r\nDistance:  9  40  200\r\n\r\nThis document describes three races:\r\n\r\n    The first race lasts 7 milliseconds.

The record distance in this race is 200 millimeters.\r\n\r\nYour toy boat has a starting speed of zero millimeters per millisecond. For each whole millisecond you spend at the beginning of the race holding down the button, the boat's speed increases by one millimeter per millisecond.\r\n\r\nSo, because the first race lasts 7 milliseconds, you only have a few options:\r\n\r\n    Don't hold the button at all (that is, hold it for 0 milliseconds) at the start of the race. The boat won't move; it will have traveled 0 millimeters by the end of the race.\r\n    Hold the button for 1 millisecond at the start of the race. Then, the boat will travel at a speed of 1 millimeter per millisecond for 6 milliseconds, reaching a total distance traveled of 6 millimeters.\r\n    Hold the button for 2 milliseconds, giving the boat a speed of 2 millimeters per millisecond. It will then get 5 milliseconds to move, reaching a total distance of 10 millimeters.\r\n    Hold the button for 3 milliseconds. After its remaining 4 milliseconds of travel time, the boat will have gone 12 millimeters.\r\n    Hold the button for 4 milliseconds. After its remaining 3 milliseconds of travel time, the boat will have gone 12 millimeters.\r\n    Hold the button for 5 milliseconds, causing the boat to travel a total of 10 millimeters.\r\n    Hold the button for 6 milliseconds, causing the boat to travel a total of 6 millimeters.\r\n    Hold the button for 7 milliseconds. That's the entire duration of the race. You never let go of the button. The boat can't move until you let go of the button. Please make sure you let go of the button so the boat gets to move. 0 millimeters.\r\n\r\nSince the current record for this race is 9 millimeters, there are actually 4 different ways you could win: you could hold the button for 2, 3, 4, or 5 milliseconds at the start of the race.\r\n\r\nIn the second race, you could hold the button for at least 4 milliseconds and at most 11 milliseconds and beat the record, a total of 8 different ways to win.\r\n\r\nIn the third race, you could hold the button for at least 11 milliseconds and no more than 19 milliseconds and still beat the record, a total of 9 ways you could win.\r\n\r\nTo see how much margin of error you have, determine the number of ways you can beat the record in each race; in this example, if you multiply these values together, you get 288 (4 * 8 * 9).\r\n\r\nDetermine the number of ways you could beat the record in each race. What do you get if you multiply these numbers together?\r\n",

            "text": "Your all-expenses-paid trip turns out to be a one-way, five-minute ride in an airship. (At least it's a cool airship!) It drops you off at the edge of a vast desert and descends back to Island Island.\r\n\r\n\"Did you bring the parts?\"\r\n\r\nYou turn around to see an Elf completely covered in white clothing, wearing goggles, and riding a large camel.\r\n\r\n\"Did you bring the parts?\" she asks again, louder this time. You aren't sure what parts she's looking for; you're here to figure out why the sand stopped.\r\n\r\n\"The parts! For the sand, yes! Come with me; I will show you.\" She beckons you onto the camel.\r\n\r\nAfter riding a bit across the sands of Desert Island, you can see what look like very large rocks covering half of the horizon. The Elf explains that the rocks are all along the part of Desert Island that is directly above Island Island, making it hard to even get there. Normally, they use big machines to move the rocks and filter the sand, but the machines have broken down because Desert Island recently stopped receiving the parts they need to fix the machines.\r\n\r\nYou've already assumed it'll be your job to figure out why the parts stopped when she asks if you can help. You agree automatically.\r\n\r\nBecause the journey will take a few days, she offers to teach you the game of Camel Cards. Camel Cards is sort of similar to poker except it's designed to be easier to play while riding a camel.\r\n\r\nIn Camel Cards, you get a list of hands, and your goal is to order them based on the strength of each hand. A hand consists of five cards labeled one of A, K, Q, J, T, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, or 2. The relative strength of each card follows this order, where A is the highest and 2 is the lowest.\r\n\r\nEvery hand is exactly one type. From strongest to weakest, they are:\r\n\r\n    Five of a kind, where all five cards have the same label: AAAAA\r\n    Four of a kind, where four cards have the same label and one card has a different label: AA8AA\r\n    Full house, where three cards have the same label, and the remaining two cards share a different label: 23332\r\n    Three of a kind, where three cards have the same label, and the remaining two cards are each different from any other card in the hand: TTT98\r\n    Two pair, where two cards share one label, two other cards share a second label, and the remaining card has a third label: 23432\r\n    One pair, where two cards share one label, and the other three cards have a different label from the pair and each other: A23A4\r\n    High card, where all cards' labels are distinct: 23456\r\n\r\nHands are primarily ordered based on type; for example, every full house is stronger than any three of a kind.\r\n\r\nIf two hands have the same type, a second ordering rule takes effect. Start by comparing the first card in each hand. If these cards are different, the hand with the stronger first card is considered stronger. If the first card in each hand have the same label, however, then move on to considering the second card in each hand. If they differ, the hand with the higher second card wins; otherwise, continue with the third card in each hand, then the fourth, then the fifth.\r\n\r\nSo, 33332 and 2AAAA are both four of a kind hands, but 33332 is stronger because its first card is stronger. Similarly, 77888 and 77788 are both a full house, but 77888 is stronger because its third card is stronger (and both hands have the same first and second card).\r\n\r\nTo play Camel Cards, you are given a list of hands and their corresponding bid (your puzzle input). For example:\r\n\r\n32T3K 765\r\nT55J5 684\r\nKK677 28\r\nKTJJT 220\r\nQQQJA 483\r\n\r\nThis example shows five hands; each hand is followed by its bid amount. Each hand wins an amount equal to its bid multiplied by its rank, where the weakest hand gets rank 1, the second-weakest hand gets rank 2, and so on up to the strongest hand. Because there are five hands in this example, the strongest hand will have rank 5 and its bid will be multiplied by 5.\r\n\r\nSo, the first step is to put the hands in order of strength:\r\n\r\n    32T3K is the only one pair and the other hands are all a stronger type, so it gets rank 1.\r\n    KK677 and KTJJT are both two pair. Their first cards both have the same label, but the second card of KK677 is stronger (K vs T), so KTJJT gets rank 2 and KK677 gets rank 3.\r\n    T55J5 and QQQJA are both three of a kind. QQQJA has a stronger first card, so it gets rank 5 and T55J5 gets rank 4.\r\n\r\nNow, you can determine the total winnings of this set of hands by adding up the result of multiplying each hand's bid with its rank (765 * 1 + 220 * 2 + 28 * 3 + 684 * 4 + 483 * 5). So the total winnings in this example are 6440.\r\n\r\nFind the rank of every hand in your set. What are the total winnings?",

            "text": "To make things a little more interesting, the Elf introduces one additional rule. Now, J cards are jokers - wildcards that can act like whatever card would make the hand the strongest type possible.\r\n\r\nTo balance this, J cards are now the weakest individual cards, weaker even than 2. The other cards stay in the same order: A, K, Q, T, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, J.\r\n\r\nJ cards can pretend to be whatever card is best for the purpose of determining hand type; for example, QJJQ2 is now considered four of a kind. However, for the purpose of breaking ties between two hands of the same type, J is always treated as J, not the card it's pretending to be: JKKK2 is weaker than QQQQ2 because J is weaker than Q.\r\n\r\nNow, the above example goes very differently:\r\n\r\n32T3K 765\r\nT55J5 684\r\nKK677 28\r\nKTJJT 220\r\nQQQJA 483\r\n\r\n    32T3K is still the only one pair; it doesn't contain any jokers, so its strength doesn't increase.\r\n    KK677 is now the only two pair, making it the second-weakest hand.\r\n    T55J5, KTJJT, and QQQJA are now all four of a kind! T55J5 gets rank 3, QQQJA gets rank 4, and KTJJT gets rank 5.\r\n\r\nWith the new joker rule, the total winnings in this example are 5905.\r\n\r\nUsing the new joker rule, find the rank of every hand in your set.

To be fair, she had just finished warning you about ghosts a few minutes ago.\r\n\r\nOne of the camel's pouches is labeled \"maps\" - sure enough, it's full of documents (your puzzle input) about how to navigate the desert. At least, you're pretty sure that's what they are; one of the documents contains a list of left\/right instructions, and the rest of the documents seem to describe some kind of network of labeled nodes.\r\n\r\nIt seems like you're meant to use the left\/right instructions to navigate the network. Perhaps if you have the camel follow the same instructions, you can escape the haunted wasteland!\r\n\r\nAfter examining the maps for a bit, two nodes stick out: AAA and ZZZ. You feel like AAA is where you are now, and you have to follow the left\/right instructions until you reach ZZZ.\r\n\r\nThis format defines each node of the network individually. For example:\r\n\r\nRL\r\n\r\nAAA = (BBB, CCC)\r\nBBB = (DDD, EEE)\r\nCCC = (ZZZ, GGG)\r\nDDD = (DDD, DDD)\r\nEEE = (EEE, EEE)\r\nGGG = (GGG, GGG)\r\nZZZ = (ZZZ, ZZZ)\r\n\r\nStarting with AAA, you need to look up the next element based on the next left\/right instruction in your input. In this example, start with AAA and go right (R) by choosing the right element of AAA, CCC. Then, L means to choose the left element of CCC, ZZZ. By following the left\/right instructions, you reach ZZZ in 2 steps.\r\n\r\nOf course, you might not find ZZZ right away. If you run out of left\/right instructions, repeat the whole sequence of instructions as necessary: RL really means RLRLRLRLRLRLRLRL... and so on. For example, here is a situation that takes 6 steps to reach ZZZ:\r\n\r\nLLR\r\n\r\nAAA = (BBB, BBB)\r\nBBB = (AAA, ZZZ)\r\nZZZ = (ZZZ, ZZZ)\r\n\r\nStarting at AAA, follow the left\/right instructions.

            "text": "You ride the camel through the sandstorm and stop where the ghost's maps told you to stop. The sandstorm subsequently subsides, somehow seeing you standing at an oasis!\r\n\r\nThe camel goes to get some water and you stretch your neck. As you look up, you discover what must be yet another giant floating island, this one made of metal! That must be where the parts to fix the sand machines come from.\r\n\r\nThere's even a hang glider partially buried in the sand here; once the sun rises and heats up the sand, you might be able to use the glider and the hot air to get all the way up to the metal island!\r\n\r\nWhile you wait for the sun to rise, you admire the oasis hidden here in the middle of Desert Island. It must have a delicate ecosystem; you might as well take some ecological readings while you wait. Maybe you can report any environmental instabilities you find to someone so the oasis can be around for the next sandstorm-worn traveler.\r\n\r\nYou pull out your handy Oasis And Sand Instability Sensor and analyze your surroundings. The OASIS produces a report of many values and how they are changing over time (your puzzle input). Each line in the report contains the history of a single value. For example:\r\n\r\n0 3 6 9 12 15\r\n1 3 6 10 15 21\r\n10 13 16 21 30 45\r\n\r\nTo best protect the oasis, your environmental report should include a prediction of the next value in each history. To do this, start by making a new sequence from the difference at each step of your history. If that sequence is not all zeroes, repeat this process, using the sequence you just generated as the input sequence. Once all of the values in your latest sequence are zeroes, you can extrapolate what the next value of the original history should be.\r\n\r\nIn the above dataset, the first history is 0 3 6 9 12 15. Because the values increase by 3 each step, the first sequence of differences that you generate will be 3 3 3 3 3. Note that this sequence has one fewer value than the input sequence because at each step it considers two numbers from the input. Since these values aren't all zero, repeat the process: the values differ by 0 at each step, so the next sequence is 0 0 0 0. This means you have enough information to extrapolate the history! Visually, these sequences can be arranged like this:\r\n\r\n0   3   6   9  12  15\r\n  3   3   3   3   3\r\n    0   0   0   0\r\n\r\nTo extrapolate, start by adding a new zero to the end of your list of zeroes; because the zeroes represent differences between the two values above them, this also means there is now a placeholder in every sequence above it:\r\n\r\n0   3   6   9  12  15   B\r\n  3   3   3   3   3   A\r\n    0   0   0   0   0\r\n\r\nYou can then start filling in placeholders from the bottom up. A needs to be the result of increasing 3 (the value to its left) by 0 (the value below it); this means A must be 3:\r\n\r\n0   3   6   9  12  15   B\r\n  3   3   3   3   3   3\r\n    0   0   0   0   0\r\n\r\nFinally, you can fill in B, which needs to be the result of increasing 15 (the value to its left) by 3 (the value below it), or 18:\r\n\r\n0   3   6   9  12  15  18\r\n  3   3   3   3   3   3\r\n    0   0   0   0   0\r\n\r\nSo, the next value of the first history is 18.\r\n\r\nFinding all-zero differences for the second history requires an additional sequence:\r\n\r\n1   3   6  10  15  21\r\n  2   3   4   5   6\r\n    1   1   1   1\r\n      0   0   0\r\n\r\nThen, following the same process as before, work out the next value in each sequence from the bottom up:\r\n\r\n1   3   6  10  15  21  28\r\n  2   3   4   5   6   7\r\n    1   1   1   1   1\r\n      0   0   0   0\r\n\r\nSo, the next value of the second history is 28.\r\n\r\nThe third history requires even more sequences, but its next value can be found the same way:\r\n\r\n10  13  16  21  30  45  68\r\n   3   3   5   9  15  23\r\n     0   2   4   6   8\r\n       2   2   2   2\r\n         0   0   0\r\n\r\nSo, the next value of the third history is 68.\r\n\r\nIf you find the next value for each history in this example and add them together, you get 114.\r\n\r\nAnalyze your OASIS report and extrapolate the next value for each history.
